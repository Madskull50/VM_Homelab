# 🛠️ Linux VM Homelab

This project is my personal IT lab environment built using **Ubuntu on VMware Workstation Player**. I'm building this from scratch to learn system administration, networking, and eventually cybersecurity tools and practices.

---

## ✅ What I’ve Done So Far

- Installed **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** in a virtual machine
- Created and executed a **system update and info script**
- Practiced essential Linux commands:
  - `sudo`, `chmod`, `grep`, `pipe (|)`
  - `ping`, `traceroute`, `ss`, `who`, `ip a`
- Verified IP address, logged-in users, and active services

---

## 📂 Included Files

- `setup-info.sh` – Bash script to update the system, show IP info, and list users
- `output.txt` – Sample output from terminal after running the script
- `commands.txt` – Command history log from this lab session

---

## 🎯 Skills I'm Practicing

- Linux command-line fundamentals
- Package management (`apt`)
- Networking basics (IP, DNS, open ports)
- Using and explaining common troubleshooting tools
- Writing and executing scripts with permissions

---

## 🚧 Coming Soon

- Add a second VM to test internal networking
- Set up SSH for remote access and key-based login
- Configure basic firewall using `ufw`
- Introduce security tools like `fail2ban`, `chkrootkit`, and `clamav`
- Document vulnerabilities and hardening steps

## 📌 Goals

My long-term goal is to build a solid foundation in Linux and IT operations as I prepare for a career in **cybersecurity**. This homelab is my hands-on learning space to develop real-world skills.
