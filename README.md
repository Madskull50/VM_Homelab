# Linux VM Homelab

This repo contains my personal IT lab using Ubuntu on VMware. I'm building this from scratch to learn system administration and cybersecurity.

## âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done So Far:
- Installed Ubuntu in VMware
- Created and ran a system update + network info script
- Practiced commands like `ping`, `traceroute`, `ss`, and `chmod`
- Documented IP settings, running services, and user info

## ðŸ”œ Coming Soon:
- Internal networking (another VM)
- SSH setup
- Firewall (ufw)
- IDS/IPS tools like fail2ban
